TARGET

-destination (file_prefix)::
  This command creates a text file with a name starting with the given

  In addition, this command also outputs the debug log information in
  separate files. Refer to *_Dump Debug Log_* for more details.

-dict (path)::

Creates a text file named dumpfile_platform_support_info.txt and stores the
platform supported data in that file. Also, dumps the debug log info in the
related files that start with the file name dumpfile_*. Refer to
*_Dump Debug Log_* for more info on the output files.
