DESCRIPTION
-----------
Utility for managing Intel Optane DC persistent memory modules (DCPMM)

Supports functionality to:

- Discover DCPMMs on the platform.
- Provision the platform memory configuration.
- View and update the firmware on DCPMMs.
- Configure data-at-rest security on DCPMMs.
- Monitor DCPMM health.
- Track performance of DCPMMs.
- Debug and troubleshoot DCPMMs.
