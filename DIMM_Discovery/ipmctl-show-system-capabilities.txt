NAME
----
ipmctl-show-system-capabilities - Shows the platform supported DCPMM capabilities

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
ipmctl show [OPTIONS] -system -capabilities

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Shows the total DCPMM memory resource allocation across the host server.

OPTIONS
-------
-a::
-all::
  Shows all attributes.

NOTE: The all and display options are exclusive and may not be used together.

-d (attributes)::
-display (attributes)::
  Filters the returned attributes by explicitly specifying a comma-separated
  list of any of the attributes defined in the Return Data section.

NOTE: The all and display options are exclusive and may not be used together.

-h::
-help::
  Displays help for the command.

-ddrt::
  Used to specify DDRT as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

-smbus::
  Used to specify SMBUS as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

NOTE: The -ddrt and -smbus options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

ifdef::os_build[]
-o (text|nvmxml)::
-output (text|nvmxml)::
  Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".
endif::os_build[]

-u (B|MB|MiB|GB|GiB|TB| TiB)::
-units (B|MB|MiB|GB|GiB|TB| TiB)::
  Changes the units that capacities are displayed in for this command. One of:
  bytes (B), megabytes (MB), mebibytes (MiB), gigabytes (GB), gibibytes (GiB),
  terabytes (TB) or tebibytes (TiB).

EXAMPLES
--------
Displays the supported DCPMM capabilities
[verse]
ipmctl show -system -capabilities

RETURN DATA
-----------
The default behavior is to return the default attributes listed below; the options can be
used to expand or restrict the output.

PlatformConfigSupported::
  (Default) Whether the platform level configuration of DCPMMs can be modified
  with the host software. One of:
  - 0: Changes must be made in the BIOS.
  - 1: The command *_Create Memory Allocation Goal_* is supported.

Alignment (Default)::
  Capacity alignment requirement for all memory types as reported by the BIOS.

AllowedVolatileMode::
  (Default) The volatile mode allowed as determined by BIOS setup. One of:
  - 1LM: One-level volatile mode. All memory resources in the platform are
    independently accessible, and not captive of the other resources.
  - Memory Mode: DCPMMs act as system memory under the control of the
    operating system. In Memory Mode, any DDR in the platform will act as a
    cache working in conjunction with the DCPMMs.
  - 1LM + 2LM: DCPMMs act as system memory under the control of the
    operating system. In addition to this, some percentage capacity of DDR
    is also used as system memory and the remamaing portion will act as
    a cache working in conjunction with the DCPMMs.
  - Unknown: The allowed volatile mode cannot be determined.

CurrentVolatileMode::
  (Default) The current volatile mode. One of:
  - 1LM: One-level volatile mode. All memory resources in the platform are
    independently accessible, and not captive of the other resources.
  - Memory Mode: DCPMMs act as system memory under the control of the
    operating system. In Memory Mode, any DDR in the platform will act as a cache
    working in conjunction with the DCPMMs.
  - 1LM + 2LM: DCPMMs act as system memory under the control of the
    operating system. In addition to this, some percentage capacity of DDR
    is also used as system memory and the remamaing portion will act as
    a cache working in conjunction with the DCPMMs.
  - Unknown: The current volatile mode cannot be determined.

AllowedAppDirectMode::
  (Default) The App Direct mode allowed as determined by BIOS setup. One of:
  - Disabled: App Direct support is currently disabled by the BIOS.
  - App Direct: App Direct support is currently enabled by the BIOS.
  - Unknown: The current App Direct support cannot be determined.

ModesSupported::
  A list of DCPMM modes supported by the BIOS. Refer to the command
  *_Show Device_* to determine the modes supported by the individual
  DCPMMs. One or more of:
  - 1LM: One-level volatile mode. All memory resources in the platform are
    independently accessible, and not captive of the other resources.
  - Memory Mode: DCPMMs act as system memory under the control of the
    operating system. In Memory Mode, any DDR in the platform will act as a cache
    working in conjunction with the DCPMMs.
  - App Direct: DCPMMs and DDR act as independent memory resources
    under direct load/store control of the application.

SupportedAppDirectSettings::
  The BIOS supported list of App Direct interleave settings in the format:
  - x[Way] - [(IMCSize) iMC x (ChannelSize) Channel] followed by the input
    format for the command *_Change Preferences_*:
    (ByOne|(IMCSize)_(ChannelSize)).

RecommendedAppDirectSettings::
  The BIOS recommended list of App Direct interleave settings in the format:
  - x[Way] - [(IMCSize) iMC x (ChannelSize) Channel] followed by the input format for
  the command *_Change Preferences_*:
  (ByOne|(IMCSize)_(ChannelSize)).

MinNamespaceSize::
  The minimum allowed namespace size as reported by the driver.

AppDirectMirrorSupported::
  If the BIOS supports App Direct mirroring. One of:
  - 0: Not supported.
  - 1: Supported

DimmSpareSupported::
  If the BIOS supports DCPMM sparing. One of:
  - 0: Not supported
  - 1: Supported

AppDirectMigrationSupported::
  If the BIOS supports App Direct migration. One of:
  - 0: Not supported
  - 1: Supported

RenameNamespaceSupported::
  If the host software supports renaming a namespace with the command Section
  <<Modify Namespace>>. One of:
  - 0: Not supported
  - 1: Supported

GrowAppDirectNamespaceSupported::
  If the host software supports increasing the capacity of an App Direct
  namespace with the command Section <<Modify Namespace>>. One of:
  - 0: Not supported
  - 1: Supported

ShrinkAppDirectNamespaceSupported::
  If the host software supports decreasing the capacity of an App Direct
  namespace with the command Section <<Modify Namespace>>. One of:
  - 0: Not supported
  - 1: Supported

InitiateScrubSupported::
  If the platform and host software support initiating an address range scrub on the
  DCPMMs in the system. One of:
  - 0: Not supported
  - 1: Supported

AdrSupported::
  Whether the platform supports asynchronous DRAM refresh (ADR). One of:
  - 0: Not supported. If ADR is not supported, App Direct data integrity cannot be
    assured during system interruptions.
