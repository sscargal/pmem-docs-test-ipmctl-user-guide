NAME
----
ipmctl-show-socket - Shows basic information about the physical processors

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
ipmctl show [OPTIONS] -socket [TARGETS]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Shows basic information about the physical processors in the host server.

OPTIONS
-------
-a::
-all::
  Shows all attributes.

NOTE: The all and display options are exclusive and may not be used together.

-d (attributes)::
-display (attributes)::
  Filters the returned attributes by explicitly specifying a comma-separated
  list of any of the attributes defined in the Return Data section.

-h::
-help::
  Displays help for the command.

-ddrt::
  Used to specify DDRT as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

-smbus::
  Used to specify SMBUS as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

NOTE: The -ddrt and -smbus options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

ifdef::os_build[]
-o (text|nvmxml)::
-output (text|nvmxml)::
  Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".
endif::os_build[]

-u (B|MB|MiB|GB|GiB|TB| TiB)::
-units (B|MB|MiB|GB|GiB|TB| TiB)::
  Changes the units that capacities are displayed in for this command. One of:
  bytes (B), megabytes (MB), mebibytes (MiB), gigabytes (GB), gibibytes (GiB),
  terabytes (TB) or tebibytes (TiB).

TARGETS
-------
-socket [SocketIDs]::
  Restricts output to the DIMMs installed on specific sockets by supplying the
  socket target and one or more comma-separated socket identifiers. The default
  is to display all sockets.

EXAMPLES
--------
Displays information about all the processors.
[verse]
ipmctl show -socket

Lists all properties for socket 1.
[verse]
ipmctl show -socket 1

Retrieves specific properties for each processor.
[verse]
ipmctl show -d MappedMemoryLimit -socket

RETURN DATA
-----------
Displays a table with the attributes listed below for each physical processor
installed in the host server.

SocketID::
  (Default) The processor socket identifier.

MappedMemoryLimit::
  (Default) The maximum amount of memory that is allowed to be mapped into the
  system physical address space for this processor based on its SKU.

TotalMappedMemory::
  (Default) The total amount of memory that is currently mapped into the system
  physical address space for this processor.
