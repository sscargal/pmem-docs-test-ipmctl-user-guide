================================
endif::manpage[]

NAME
----
ifndef::os_build[]
ipmctl-enable-device-security - Enable data-at-rest security on DCPMM
endif::os_build[]
ifdef::os_build[]
ipmctl-enable-device-security - Enable data-at-rest security on DCPMM on supported OS
endif::os_build[]

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
ipmctl set [OPTIONS] -dimm [TARGETS] NewPassphrase=(string)
ConfirmPassphrase=(string)

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Enable data-at-rest security for the persistent memory on one or more DCPMMs
by setting a passphrase.

ifdef::os_build[]
NOTE: This command is subject to OS Vendor (OSV) support. It will return "Not Supported."
endif::os_build[]

OPTIONS
-------
-h::
-help::
  Displays help for the command.

-ddrt::
  Used to specify DDRT as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

-smbus::
  Used to specify SMBUS as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

NOTE: The -ddrt and -smbus options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

-source (path)::
  File path to a local file containing the new passphrase (1-32 characters).

NOTE: The file does not need to contain the ConfirmPassphrase property

TARGETS
-------
-dimm [DimmIDs]::
  Set the passphrase on specific DCPMMs by supplying one or more comma
  separated DCPMM identifiers. However, this is not recommended as it
  may put the system in an undesirable state. The default is to set the
  passphrase on all manageable DCPMMs.

PROPERTIES
----------
NewPassphrase::
  The new passphrase (1-32 characters). For better passphrase protection,
  specify an empty string (e.g., NewPassphrase="") to be prompted for the
  passphrase or to use a file containing the passphrase with the source option.

ConfirmPassphrase::
  Confirmation of the new passphrase (1-32 character and must match
  NewPassphrase). For better passphrase protection, specify an empty string
  (e.g., ConfirmPassphrase="") to be prompted for the passphrase or to use a
  file containing the passphrase with the source option.

EXAMPLES
--------
Set a passphrase on DIMM 0x0001.
[verse]
ipmctl set -dimm 0x0001 NewPassphrase=123 ConfirmPassphrase=123

Sets a passphrase on DCPMM 0x0001 by supplying the passphrase in the file
mypassphrase.file. In this example, the format of the file would be:

#ascii +
NewPassphrase=myNewPassphrase

[verse]
ipmctl set -source mypassphrase.file -dimm 0x0001 NewPassphrase="" ConfirmPassphrase=""

LIMITATIONS
-----------
In order to successfully execute this command:

The caller must have the appropriate privileges. The specified DCPMM must
have security disabled and be manageable by the host software.

There must not be any goal creation pending.

ifdef::os_build[]
Command is subject to OS Vendor (OSV) support. If OSV does not provide support,
command will return "Not Supported."
endif::os_build[]

RETURN DATA
-----------
If empty strings are provided for the passphrase properties and the source option is not
included, the user will be prompted (once for all DCPMMs) to enter the new
passphrase and then again to confirm the new passphrase as described below. The
passphrase characters will be hidden.

New passphrase: \\****
 +
Confirm new passphrase: \****

For each DCPMM, the CLI will indicate the status of the set passphrase
operation. If a failure occurs when setting the passphrase on multiple DCPMMs,
the process will exit and not continue updating the remaining DCPMMs.

SAMPLE OUTPUT
------------
[verse]
Set passphrase on DIMM (DimmID): Success

[verse]
Set passphrase on DIMM (DimmID): Error (Code) - (Description)
