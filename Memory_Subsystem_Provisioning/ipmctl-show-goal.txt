ipmctl-show-goal(1)
===================
endif::manpage[]

NAME
----
ipmctl-show-goal - Shows the memory allocation goal on one or more DCPMM

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
ipmctl show [OPTIONS] -goal [TARGETS] [PROPERTIES]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Shows the memory allocation goal on one or more DCPMMs. Once the goal is
successfully applied by the BIOS, it is no longer displayed. Use the command
Section <<Show Memory Resources>> to view the system-wide memory resources
or the command *_Show Persistent Memory_* for detailed persistent
memory information.

OPTIONS
-------
-a::
-all::
  Shows all attributes.

NOTE: The all and display options are exclusive and may not be used together.

-d (attributes)::
-display (attributes)::
  Filters the returned attributes by explicitly specifying a comma-separated
  list of any of the attributes defined in the Return Data section.

NOTE: The all and display options are exclusive and may not be used together.

-h::
-help::
    Displays help for the command.

-ddrt::
  Used to specify DDRT as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

-smbus::
  Used to specify SMBUS as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

NOTE: The -ddrt and -smbus options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

ifdef::os_build[]
-o (text|nvmxml)::
-output (text|nvmxml)::
    Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".
endif::os_build[]

-u (B|MB|MiB|GB|GiB|TB| TiB)::
-units (B|MB|MiB|GB|GiB|TB| TiB)::
    Changes the units that capacities are displayed in for this command. One of:
    bytes (B), megabytes (MB), mebibytes (MiB), gigabytes (GB), gibibytes (GiB),
    terabytes (TB) or tebibytes (TiB).

TARGETS
-------
-dimm [DimmIDs]::
  Restricts output to specific DCPMMs by supplying one or more comma separated
  DCPMM identifiers. The default is to display all manageable DCPMMs with memory
  allocation goals.

-socket [SocketIds]::
  Restricts output to the DCPMMs on specific sockets by supplying the socket
  target and one or more comma-separated socket identifiers. The default is to
  display all manageable DCPMMs on all sockets with memory allocation goals.

EXAMPLES
--------
Shows the default memory allocation goal attributes for each DCPMM.
[verse]
ipmctl show -goal

Shows all the memory allocation goal attributes for the DCPMMs on socket 1.
[verse]
ipmctl show -a -goal -socket 1

LIMITATIONS
-----------
The specified DCPMMs must be manageable by the host software.

RETURN DATA
-----------
The default behavior is to display a table with the default attributes for each
DCPMM; applying options changes the output to a more detailed format.

SocketID::
  (Default) The processor socket identifier where the DCPMM is installed.

DimmID:: (Default)
  The DCPMM identifier

MemorySize::
  (Default) The DCPMM capacity that will be configured in Memory Mode.

AppDirect1Size::
  (Default) The DCPMM capacity that will be configured as the first App Direct
  interleave set if applicable.

AppDirect1Index::
  Unique identifier of the first App Direct interleave set.
  - N/A: If no App Direct interleave set
  - Numeric value if App Direct interleave set is present.

AppDirect1Settings::
  The settings for the first App Direct interleave set in the format: x(Way)
  [- (Size) iMC] [x (Size) Channel]

AppDirect2Size::
  (Default) The DCPMM capacity that will be configured as the second App
  Direct interleave set if applicable.

AppDirect2Index::
  Unique identifier of the second App Direct interleave set.
  - N/A: If no App Direct interleave set
  - Numeric value if App Direct interleave set is present.

AppDirect2Settings::
  The settings for the second App Direct interleave set in the format: x(Way)
  [- (Size) iMC] [x (Size) Channel]

Status::
The status of the memory allocation goal. One of:
  - Unknown: The status cannot be determined.
  - New: A reboot is required for the memory allocation goal to be processed by
    the BIOS.
  - Failed - Bad request: The BIOS failed to process the memory allocation goal
    because it was invalid.
  - Failed - Not enough resources: There were not enough resources for the BIOS
    to process the memory allocation goal.
  - Failed - Firmware error: The BIOS failed to process the memory allocation
    goal due to a firmware error.
  - Failed - Unknown: The BIOS failed to process the memory allocation goal due
    to an unknown error.

SAMPLE OUTPUT
-------------
If a new memory allocation goal has been created, a prompt to reboot will be
presented.
[verse]
A reboot is required to process new memory allocation goals.
