ipmctl-dump-goal(1)
===================
endif::manpage[]

NAME
----
ipmctl-dump-goal - Stores the current system configuration in a file

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
ipmctl dump [OPTIONS] -destination (path) -system -config

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Store the currently configured memory allocation settings for all DCPMMs in the
system to a file in order to replicate the configuration elsewhere. Apply the
stored memory allocation settings using the command Section
<<Load Memory Allocation Goal>>.

OPTIONS
-------
-h::
-help::
    Displays help for the command.

-ddrt::
  Used to specify DDRT as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

-smbus::
  Used to specify SMBUS as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

NOTE: The -ddrt and -smbus options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

-lpmb::
  Used to specify large transport payload size for the current invocation of ipmctl.

-spmb::
  Used to specify small transport payload size for the current invocation of ipmctl.

NOTE: The -lpmb and -spmb options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

ifdef::os_build[]
-o (text|nvmxml)::
-output (text|nvmxml)::
    Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".
endif::os_build[]

EXAMPLES
--------
Stores the memory allocation settings from all the DCPMMs into the file "config.txt".
[verse]
ipmctl dump -destination config.txt -system -config

LIMITATIONS
-----------
Only memory allocation settings for manageable DCPMMs that have been
successfully applied by the BIOS are stored in the file. Unconfigured DCPMMs are
not included, nor are memory allocation goals that have not been applied.

RETURN DATA
-----------
The CLI will indicate the overall status of the operation when complete. If a
failure occurs when dumping the memory allocation from multiple DCPMMs, the
process will stop and the output file will be removed.

The output file is formatted as an ASCII file with one row per DCPMM containing
the following comma-separated values.

SocketID::
  unsigned short int Identifier for the socket the DCPMM is associated with.

DimmHandle::
  unsigned int DCPMM device handle.

Capacity::
  unsigned long long int Total capacity of the DCPMM in GiB.

MemorySize::
  unsigned long long int Capacity of the DCPMM allocated as Memory Mode in GiB.

AppDirect1Size::
  unsigned long long int Capacity of the DCPMM allocated for the first App
  Direct interleave set in GiB.

AppDirect1Format::
  unsigned short int Bit mask representing the interleave format of the first
  App Direct interleave set.

AppDirect1Mirrored::
  unsigned char 1 if the first App Direct interleave set is mirrored, 0
  otherwise.

AppDirect1Index::
  unsigned short int Unique index of the first App Direct interleave set.

AppDirect2Size::
  unsigned long long int Capacity of the DCPMM allocated for the second App
  Direct interleave set in GiB.

AppDirect2Format::
  unsigned short int Bit mask representing the interleave format of the second
  App Direct interleave set.

AppDirect2Mirrored::
  unsigned char 1 if the second App Direct interleave set is mirrored, 0
  otherwise.

AppDirect2Index::
  unsigned short int Unique index of the second App Direct interleave set.
