-h::
-help::
    Displays help for the command.

-ddrt::
  Used to specify DDRT as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

-smbus::
  Used to specify SMBUS as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

NOTE: The -ddrt and -smbus options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

-lpmb::
  Used to specify large transport payload size for the current invocation of ipmctl.

-spmb::
  Used to specify small transport payload size for the current invocation of ipmctl.

ifdef::os_build[]
-o (text|nvmxml)::
-output (text|nvmxml)::
    Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".
endif::os_build[]

TARGETS
-------
-dimm [DimmIDs]::
  Deletes the memory allocation goal from specific DCPMMs by optionally supplying one or
  more comma-separated DCPMM identifiers. The default is to delete the memory
  allocation goals from all manageable DCPMMs.

-socket [SocketIds]::
  Deletes the memory allocation goal from the DCPMMs on specific sockets by
  supplying the socket target and one or more comma-separated socket
  identifiers. The default is to delete the memory allocation goals from
  manageable DCPMMs on all sockets.

EXAMPLES
--------
Deletes the memory allocation goal from all DCPMMs on all sockets.
[verse]
ipmctl delete -goal

LIMITATIONS
-----------
The appropriate privileges and the specified DCPMM(s) must be manageable by the
host software and unlocked if security is enabled.
given socket and all specified DCPMMs must contain a memory allocation goal.

RETURN DATA
-----------
For each DCPMM, the CLI will indicate the status of the operation. If a failure occurs
when deleting the memory allocation goals from multiple DCPMMs, the process will
output a failure message for those DCPMMs that did not succeed and a success
message for those that did.

SAMPLE OUTPUT
-------------
[verse]
Delete memory allocation goal from DIMM (DimmID): Success
