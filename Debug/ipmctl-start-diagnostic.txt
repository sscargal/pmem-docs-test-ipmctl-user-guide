NAME
----
ipmctl-start-diagnostic - Starts a diagnostic test

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
ipmctl start [OPTIONS] -diagnostic [TARGETS]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Starts a diagnostic test.

OPTIONS
-------
-h::
-help::
  Displays help for the command.

-ddrt::
  Used to specify DDRT as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

-smbus::
  Used to specify SMBUS as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

NOTE: The -ddrt and -smbus options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

-lpmb::
  Used to specify large transport payload size for the current invocation of ipmctl.

-spmb::
  Used to specify small transport payload size for the current invocation of ipmctl.

NOTE: The -lpmb and -spmb options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

ifdef::os_build[]
-o (text|nvmxml)::
-output (text|nvmxml)::
  Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".
endif::os_build[]

TARGETS
-------
-diagnostic [Quick|Config|Security|FW]::
  Start a specific test by supplying its name. By default all tests are run.
  One of:
  - "Quick" - This test verifies that the DCPMM host mailbox is accessible and
    that basic health indicators can be read and are currently reporting
    acceptable values.
  - "Config" - This test verifies that the BIOS platform configuration matches
    the installed hardware and the platform configuration conforms to best known
    practices.
  - "Security" - This test verifies that all DCPMMs have a consistent security
    state. It's a best practice to enable security on all DCPMMs rather than
    just some.
  - "FW" - This test verifies that all DCPMMs of a given model have consistent
    FW installed and other FW modifiable attributes are set in accordance with
    best practices. +
    Note that the test does not have a means of verifying that
    the installed FW is the optimal version for a given DCPMM model just that
    it's been consistently applied across the system.

-dimm [DimmIDS]::
  Starts a diagnostic test on specific DCPMMs by optionally supplying one or more
  comma-separated DCPMM identifiers. The default is to start the specified tests
  on all manageable DCPMMs. Only valid for the Quick diagnostic test.

EXAMPLES
--------
Starts all diagnostics.
[verse]
ipmctl start -diagnostic

Starts the quick check diagnostic on DCPMM 0x0001
[verse]
ipmctl start -diagnostic Quick -dimm 0x0001

LIMITATIONS
-----------
If a DCPMM is unmanageable, then Quick test will report the reason, while
Config, Security and FW tests will skip unmanageable DCPMMs.

RETURN DATA
-----------
Each diagnostic generates one or more log messages. A successful test generates a
single log message per DCPMM indicating that no errors were found. A failed test
might generate multiple log messages each highlighting a specific error with all
the relevant details. Each log contains the following information.

Test::
  The test name along with overall execution result. One of:
  - "Quick"
  - "Config"
  - "Security"
  - "FW"

Message::
  The message indicates the status of the test. One of:
  - "Ok"
  - "Failed"

Result Code::
  Event code associated with message.

SubTestName::
  The subtest name for given Test.
  For "Quick", sub-tests are :
  - "Manageability"
  - "Boot status"
  - "Health"

  For "Config", sub-tests are:
  - "Dimm specs"
  - "Duplicate Dimm"
  - "System Capability"
  - "Namespace LSA"
  - "PCD"

  For "Security", sub-tests are:
  - "Encryption status"
  - "Inconsistency"

  For "FW", sub-tests are:
  - "FW Consistency"
  - "Viral Policy"
  - "Threshold check"
  - "System Time"

State::
  The severity of the error for each sub-test displayed with SubTestName. One of:
  - "Ok"
  - "Warning"
  - "Failed"
  - "Aborted"

Message::
  A free form textual description of the error associated with eact subtest.

EventCode::
  Event code associated with Message.
