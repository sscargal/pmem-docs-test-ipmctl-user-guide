DESCRIPTION
-----------
Shows thermal or media errors on the specified DCPMMs.

OPTIONS
-------
-h::
-help::
  Displays help for the command.

-ddrt::
  Used to specify DDRT as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

-smbus::
  Used to specify SMBUS as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

-o (text|nvmxml)::
-output (text|nvmxml)::
  Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".
endif::os_build[]

TARGETS
-------
-dimm [DimmIDs]::
  Filter output to events on a specific DCPMM by supplying the dimm target and
  one DCPMM identifier.

PROPERTIES
----------
SequenceNumber::
  Error log entries are stored with a sequence number starting with 1 and
  rolling over back to 1 after 65535. Limit the error log entries returned by
  providing a sequence number. Only errors with a sequence number equal to or
  higher than provided will be returned. The default is 1.

Level::
  Severity level of errors to be fetched. One of:
  - "High": High severity errors (Default)
  - "Low": Low severity errors

Count::
  Max number of error entries to be fetched and printed.
  The default is 8 for media errors and 16 for thermal errors.

EXAMPLES
--------
Show all high thermal error log entries
[verse]
ipmctl show -error Thermal Level=High

Show all low media error log entries
[verse]
ipmctl show -error Thermal Level=High

LIMITATIONS
-----------
To successfully execute this command, the specified DCPMM(s) must be manageable
by the host software.

RETURN DATA
-----------
Prints errors of the specified type for the specified DCPMMs. If no errors are found, the
following message will be printed:
[verse]
No errors found on DIMM (DimmID)
