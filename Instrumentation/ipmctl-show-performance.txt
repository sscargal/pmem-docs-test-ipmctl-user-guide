==========================

NAME
----
ipmctl-show-performance - Shows performance metrics for one or more DCPMMs

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
ipmctl show [OPTIONS] -performance [METRICS] [TARGETS]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Shows performance metrics for one or more DCPMMs.

OPTIONS
-------
-h::
-help::
  Displays help for the command.

-ddrt::
  Used to specify DDRT as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

-smbus::
  Used to specify SMBUS as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

NOTE: The -ddrt and -smbus options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

ifdef::os_build[]
-o (text|nvmxml)::
-output (text|nvmxml)::
  Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".
endif::os_build[]

METRICS
-------
Restricts output to a specific performance metric by supplying the metric name.
See RETURN DATA for more information. One of:

  - MediaReads
  - MediaWrites
  - ReadRequests
  - WriteRequests
  - TotalMediaReads
  - TotalMediaWrites
  - TotalReadRequests
  - TotalWriteRequests

The default is to display all performance metrics.

TARGETS
-------
-dimm [DimmIDs]::
  Restricts output to the performance metrics for specific DCPMM by supplying
  one or more comma separated DCPMM identifiers. The default is to display
  performance metrics for all manageable DCPMM.


EXAMPLES
--------
Shows all performance metrics for all DCPMMs in the server.
[verse]
ipmctl show -dimm -performance

Shows the number of 64 byte reads since last AC cycle for all DCPMMs in the
server.
[verse]
ipmctl show -dimm -performance MediaReads

RETURN DATA
-----------
This command displays a table of the specified metrics for each specified DCPMM.
Applying a specific DCPMM target limits the rows in the table. Applying a
specific metric name target limits the columns in the table.

DimmID::
  The DCPMM identifier

MediaReads::
  Number of 64 byte reads from media on the DCPMM since last AC cycle.

MediaWrites::
  Number of 64 byte writes to media on the DCPMM since last AC cycle.

ReadRequests::
  Number of DDRT read transactions the DCPMM has serviced since last AC cycle.

WriteRequests::
  Number of DDRT write transactions the DCPMM has serviced since last AC cycle.

TotalMediaReads::
  Number of 64 byte reads from media on the DCPMM over its lifetime.

TotalMediaWrites::
  Number of 64 byte writes to media on the DCPMM over its lifetime.

TotalReadRequest::
  Number of DDRT read transactions the DCPMM has serviced over its lifetime.

TotalWriteRequest::
  Number of DDRT write transactions the DCPMM has serviced over its lifetime.
