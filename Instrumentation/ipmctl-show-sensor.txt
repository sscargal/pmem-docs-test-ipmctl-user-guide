=====================

NAME
----
ipmctl-show-sensor - Shows health statistics for one or more DCPMMs

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
ipmctl show [OPTIONS] -sensor [SENSORS] [TARGETS]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
ipmctl-show-device to view more detailed information about a DCPMM.

OPTIONS
-------
-a::
-all::
  Shows all attributes.

NOTE: The all and display options are exclusive and may not be used together.

-d (attributes)::
-display (attributes)::
  Filters the returned attributes by explicitly specifying a comma-separated
  list of any of the attributes defined in the Return Data section.

NOTE: The all and display options are exclusive and may not be used together.

-h::
-help::
  Displays help for the command.

-ddrt::
  Used to specify DDRT as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

-smbus::
  Used to specify SMBUS as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

NOTE: The -ddrt and -smbus options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

ifdef::os_build[]
-o (text|nvmxml)::
-output (text|nvmxml)::
  Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".
endif::os_build[]

SENSORS
-------
Health::
  (Default) The current DCPMM health as reported in the SMART log

MediaTemperature::
  (Default) The current DCPMM media temperature in Celsius

ControllerTemperature::
  (Default) The current DCPMM controller temperature in Celsius

PercentageRemaining::
  (Default) Remaining DCPMM’s life as a percentage value of factory expected
  life span

LatchedDirtyShutdownCount::
  (Default) The number of shutdowns without notification over the lifetime of
  the DCPMM

UnlatchedDirtyShutdownCount::
  (Default) The number of shutdowns without notification over the lifetime of
  the DCPMM. This counter is the same as LatchedDirtyShutdownCount except it will
  always be incremented on a dirty shutdown, even if Latch System Shutdown Status
  was not enabled

PowerOnTime::
  (Default) The total power-on time over the lifetime of the DCPMM

UpTime::
  (Default) The total power-on time since the last power cycle of the DCPMM

PowerCycles::
  (Default) The number of power cycles over the lifetime of the DCPMM

FwErrorCount::
  The total number of firmware error log entries

TARGETS
-------
-dimm [DimmIDs]::
  Restricts output to the sensors on specific DCPMMs by supplying the DIMM
  target and one or more comma-separated DCPMM identifiers. The default is to
  display sensors for all manageable DCPMMs.

EXAMPLES
--------
Gets all sensor information for all DCPMMs.
[verse]
ipmctl show -sensor

Shows the media temperature sensor for the specified DCPMM.
[verse]
ipmctl show -sensor MediaTemperature -dimm 1234

LIMITATIONS
-----------
The specified DCPMM(s) must be manageable by the host software.

RETURN DATA
-----------
This command displays a table with a row for each sensor on each DCPMM. Applying
a specific DCPMM or sensor type target limits the number of rows. Applying
options can be used to expand or restrict the output.

DimmID::
  (Default) The DCPMM identifier

Type::
  (Default) The sensor type. Refer to the sensor table above.

CurrentValue::
  (Default) The current reading followed by the units of measurement
  (e.g., 57 °C or 25%)

AlarmThreshold::
  The threshold value at which an alarm for the respective sensor will be triggered.

ThrottlingStopThreshold::
  The threshold value at which firmware will stop throttling to reduce overall thermals and keep the DIMM within safe operating temperatures.

ThrottlingStartThreshold::
  The threshold value at which firmware will start throttling to reduce overall thermals and keep the DIMM within safe operating temperatures.

ShutdownThreshold::
  The threshold value at which device shutdown will occur.

SettableThresholds::
  A list of user settable thresholds. Zero or more of:
  - "AlarmThreshold"

SupportedThresholds::
  A list of supported thresholds. Zero or more of:
  - "AlarmThreshold"
  - "ThrottlingStopThreshold"
  - "ThrottlingStartThreshold"
  - "ShutdownThreshold"

EnabledState::
  Whether the alarm threshold is enabled, disabled or not applicable.
  One of:
  - 0: Disabled
  - 1: Enabled
  - N/A
